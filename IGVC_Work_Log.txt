28JUN2015 - DML Recommendations  
------------------------------------------
Recommendation for Integrated Developement Environment (IDE): This is not required, many programmers do not use IDEs. For those who wish to use one for ROS and CPP development I recommend QtCreator. Strengths: It integrates nicely with ROS and Git repos, and it is light weight. Weakness: Limited python support.

Recommendation for OS and ROS version: Switch the next LTS of UBUNTU and ROS in the summer 2017. We should follow the ROS long term service release schedule with a one year delay. ROS follows the release cycle fof UBUNTU with about a one month delay. The next long term release for Ubuntu and ROS is due out in the summer fo 2016, USMA should wait until the summer of 2017 for those versions to stabalize before adopting them. The current UBUNTU Trusty TAR LTS and ROS Indigo Igloo reach their end of life in 2019.

12MAY2015 - DML getting turtlebot to nav
=====================================================
QTCreator integration with ROS.

How TO:
Build Steps
1. Add Build Step
   a. Custom process step
        1. Command: catkin_make
        2. Working Directory: /home/user1/codeblocks_ws/src/usma_pc_linedetector/src
2. Remove Item: make
Build Environment
1. PWD: /home/user1/codeblocks_ws
2. Add
    a. INCLUDEPATH: /home/user1/codeblocks_ws/src/usma_line_detector/include/usma_line_detector/

ROS expects the build to be in:
/home/user1/catkin_ws/devel/lib/PROJECT_NAME/

QTCreator installed to directions on ROS Wiki puts build in this location:
/home/user1/codeblocks_ws/build/devel/lib/usma_line_detector

Need to remove the build subdirectory

/opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake

======================================================
# Allow user1 to dialout on USB devices
sudo adduser user1 dialout

sudo apt-get install meld
sudo apt-get install minicom

# Change to default scroll batrs on side windows
gsettings set com.canonical.desktop.interface scrollbar-mode normal

======================================================
29MAR2015 - DML Started with new install of Ubntu 14.04
======================================================
1. Followed these instructions to install ROS Indigo:
	http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu

	1. sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

	2. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
	
	3. sudo apt-get update

	4. sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full

	5. echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

	6. source ~/.bashrc

	7. sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall

2. In order to have a quick way to clear the screen I added the below line to ~/.bashrc 
	alias cls='printf "\033c"'

3. In System Settings/All Settings/Brightness & Lock
	a. Turned the Lock off
	b. Disabled "Dim screen to save power"
	c. Set "Turn screen off when inactive for:" 30 minutes

4. In the ~/.bashrc file changed the below settings to lengthen the history file. This makes it much easier to find what was done to the computer in the past. I just add a couple zeros to each setting.

	HISTSIZE=100000
	HISTFILESIZE=200000

5. Edited the Terminal's Default Profile to make the following change:
	On the Scrolling tab - checked the block for "Unlimited scrolling"

6. Setup ROS workspace for catkin following the directions at:
	http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment

	1. mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
	2. cd ~/catkin_ws/src
	3. catkin_init_workspace
	4. cd ~/catkin_ws/
	5. catkin_make

7. Then to permanently source the configuration file:
	echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
