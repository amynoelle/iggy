IGVC Roadmap

Short Term Fixes:
-Hardware
    Chassis:
        Screws come loose → lock tight
    Sensors:
        Replace broken GPS cable 
    Power system:
        Wall power
        
-Software
    Pass qualification course before next year gets it
        White line on costmap
        Object avoidance tinkering → obstacle at correct height (ground segmentation code)
    Clean up code:
        Everything in correct places and only what is actually needed on computer
        List/executable to install all packages required
        Put TFs in correct scale → (0,0) scale instead of GPS grid in meters scale

Mid-Long Term improvements:
-Hardware
    Adjust Chassis:
        Top heavy, technically ½ inch too tall
        Wheel clearance from shocks structure too low?
    Sensor locations:
        Move LiDAR lower?
        Move GPS antenna above LiDAR?
        Move bumblebee2 Camera lower, at less of an angle?
        Encoders (1 or 2):
            1. Troubleshoot existing ones in motor casing
                Take it apart and look inside?
            2. Create more waterproof ones on exterior
    Computer
        Put in other power supply with all cables → 12V input power supply?
        Reduce sun glare on monitor → new high intensity monitor? Shade structure
        Table for mouse/keyboard → from cover?
        Wireless mouse/keyboard
    DINRAIL:
        Buy extra parts for all components → circuit breakers, nodes, diodes
        Label maker
        longer rail? Increase nodes so that 2/3 things aren't in one node
    Power system:
        12V and 24V source? Rather than having a 24V-12V converter
            possible to still have them in series with current draw?
        More amp-hours → increase the amount of military batteries or use LiFePo4?
    Robot internal network/Router → integrate for LiDAR/eth use
        Identify why Internet connection lost when LiDAR running
        
-Software
    Roboteq driver code → initialize without xbox controller/autonous commands being sent
    Git Repo clean up → remove multiple levels


Purchases:
    Wall power source
    GPS cable
    DINRAIL components: circuit breakers, nodes, diodes

    Computer power supply?
    High intensity monitor?
    Wireless mouse/keyboard?
    Battery/Power system?
